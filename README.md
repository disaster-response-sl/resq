MONGO_URI=<mongodb-atlas-url>        # Database connection
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
```

**See [RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md](./RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md) for complete setup guide.**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Production Issues

**1. Login Fails with 500 Error**
- ❌ Missing `JWT_SECRET` on Render
- ✅ Add environment variable: See [RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md](./RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md)
- ✅ Verify with: `curl https://resq-backend-3efi.onrender.com/api/test`

**2. Relief Camps Show Empty or Error**
- ⚠️ External Supabase API may be slow/unavailable
- ✅ Backend now returns empty array gracefully (not critical)
- ✅ Shows: "Relief camps service temporarily unavailable"

**3. CORS Errors in Production**
- ✅ Fixed: Backend allows all `*.vercel.app` domains
- ✅ Redeploy backend if still seeing errors

### Local Development Issues

**1. MongoDB Connection Error**
- Verify `MONGO_URI` in `.env` file
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas (add 0.0.0.0/0 for development)
- Test connection: `mongosh <your-mongo-uri>`

**2. Backend Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Windows: Find and kill process on port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <process-id> /F

# Or change PORT in .env file
```

**3. Frontend Can't Connect to Backend**
- Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- Check `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in frontend `.env`
- Clear browser cache and reload

**4. GPS Location Issues**
- Enable location permissions in browser
- Use HTTPS (required for geolocation API)
- Check device GPS settings
- Verify location services are enabled

**5. Leaflet Map Not Displaying**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify map container has explicit height (600px)
- Import Leaflet CSS: `import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css'`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check backend logs
cd src/web-dashboard/backend
npm run dev

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Test MongoDB connection
curl http://localhost:5000/api/public/stats

# Check frontend build
cd src/web-dashboard/frontend
npm run build

# Mobile app logs
cd src/MobileApp
npx react-native log-android
npx react-native log-ios
```

### Verification Checklist

## 🔧 Technical Improvements & Optimizations

### Performance Enhancements
- ✅ **Debounced Search** - Relief Tracker radius slider with 800ms delay prevents notification spam
- ✅ **Lazy Loading** - Efficient component loading reduces initial bundle size
- ✅ **Geospatial Indexing** - MongoDB 2dsphere index for fast location queries
- ✅ **CDN Distribution** - Vercel Edge Network for global low-latency access
- ✅ **API Response Caching** - Reduced redundant external API calls

### Error Handling & Resilience
- ✅ **JWT Validation** - Backend checks for JWT_SECRET before authentication
- ✅ **Supabase Fallback** - Graceful degradation when external API unavailable
- ✅ **CORS Configuration** - Supports all Vercel preview deployments (*.vercel.app)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging** - Console logging for debugging production issues
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - 10,000 requests per 15 min (5 for auth endpoints)
- ✅ **Input Sanitization** - NoSQL injection prevention

### Location Services
- ✅ **Reverse Geocoding** - Accurate address from coordinates
  - Direct Nominatim API (10s timeout)
  - Backend proxy fallback (12s timeout)
  - Shows: "St Mary's Road, Kochchikade, Gampaha District"
- ✅ **Location Autocomplete** - Search locations by name (Nominatim)
- ✅ **Distance Calculations** - Haversine formula for accurate distances
- ✅ **CORS Proxy** - `/api/geocode/reverse` endpoint avoids browser CORS issues

### Mobile Responsiveness
- ✅ **Adaptive Layouts** - Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- ✅ **Touch-Friendly UI** - Larger buttons and spacing on mobile
- ✅ **Responsive Grid** - 2 columns on mobile, 4-5 on desktop
- ✅ **Navbar Visibility** - Logo and subtitle visible on all screen sizes
- ✅ **Mobile-First Design** - Progressive enhancement approach

### Security Features
- ✅ **Helmet.js** - Secure HTTP headers
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** - Stateless token-based auth
- ✅ **Environment Variables** - Secure secret management
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement** - SSL certificates on production
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Brute force protection
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Prevents injection attacks

### Monitoring & Observability
- ✅ **Health Check Endpoint** - `/api/health` for uptime monitoring
- ✅ **Test Endpoint** - `/api/test` shows environment status
- ✅ **Console Logging** - Structured logs with emojis (✅, ❌, ⚠️)
- ✅ **Error Tracking** - Comprehensive error messages
- ✅ **API Response Logging** - Track external API calls

## 🎯 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- ⚠️ **Mock Authentication** - Uses Individual ID + OTP instead of real SLUDI
- ⚠️ **Supabase Dependency** - Relief camps may be unavailable if external API down
- ⚠️ **Single Language** - Currently English only (Sinhala/Tamil planned)
- ⚠️ **No Real-Time Sync** - Dashboard updates on refresh (WebSocket planned)

### Planned Features
- 🔮 **Real SLUDI Integration** - Connect to actual eSignet authentication
- 🔮 **Multi-Language Support** - Sinhala, Tamil, English
- 🔮 **Push Notifications** - Real-time alerts to mobile devices
- 🔮 **Offline Mode** - Service worker for offline access
- 🔮 **WebSocket Integration** - Live dashboard updates
- 🔮 **Advanced Analytics** - Predictive disaster modeling
- 🔮 **SMS Gateway** - Send alerts via SMS for areas without internet
- 🔮 **Drone Integration** - Aerial surveillance and delivery coordination
